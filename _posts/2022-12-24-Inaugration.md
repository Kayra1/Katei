So, I'm starting a blog. I've always had reservations about putting my 
thoughts in a public space, but I've also always wanted a blog, and today my 
latter desire won over the first. I think and write a lot, so it would be nice 
to have a repository to collect all of the thoughts and ideas I've had over the 
years.

This blog will most likely contain things about:
* Programming
* Tech Industry
* Money and economy
* Reviews of games, movies, TV shows and books
* Rambling

This blog will also, hopefully in the future if I ever get a stable life, contain things about:
* Travel
* 3D Printing
* Sailing
* Martial arts
* Music
* Architecture
* Drawing

If you want to follow along or you just like to read, you can use the categories and tags to
read things you find relevant to you.

It feels foreign and also somehow comforting to refer to the reader in the second person like this.

Welcome.
